// Organisation name
// Extremely brief bio of what they're about/what their purpose/mission is - like our "ten second intro"
// Volunteer opportunities and expectations (list with a very short description for each type of volunteer opportunity along with very clear expectations section incl. time commitment and any other essential requirements i.e. DBS check)
// Something fun and dating-app-y to get the vibe of the org... OKCupid had the "What three things could you not live without" - something similar to this perhaps?
// Contact info for potential volunteers to get in touch (display during the shortlist)
