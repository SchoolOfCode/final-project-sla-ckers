PLAN FOR LOGIN:

- Need logic to listen for auth state change (via Firebase) and set the loggedInUser state accordingly - presumably on this level, so we can conditionally render the org form and the logout button once the user is logged in -> as set up but commented out for now below.

- INITIAL FLOW:
  1. User goes to org dashboard -> 
  2. User sees login form, where they either register or log in (form can do either) -> 
  3. Once they're logged in, loggedInUser contains user data for their session ->
  4. Login form goes away, and org form and logout button are rendered 

- After the flow above is set up, need to then add in the edit capabilities so that if the user account is already associated with an organisation, the data pulls through into the org form and it then becomes a put rather than a post req to edit their details... No clue yet how to work through this one! One step at a time. Will worry about that once the basic logging in is hooked up and working. 

- Test accounts:
  test@testy.test, pass: testing
  slackers@soc.com, pass: finalproject
  cors@test.com, pass: corserror
  fresh@test.com, pass: sofreshsoclean

- FLOW WITH EDIT CAPABILITY:
1. User logs in or signs up => generates a uid from firebase user object
2. uid is passed down to InputComponent when it's rendered 
3. useEffects fire: 
  a) formDispatch case UID_CHANGE adds the uid to the orgData state and then fetches all orgs and sets them to the allOrgs state 
  b) triggered when allOrgs changes, the second useEffect filters allOrgs for an org containing the uid and sets this to the matchedOrgData state; if matchedOrg is true, formDispatch case MATCHED_ORG_CHANGE populates the orgData to matchedOrg
4. One of two form versions renders:
  a) if matchedOrgData has data:
      Form renders with edit message and handleEditSubmit, which triggers a PUT request
  a) if matchedOrgData does not have data:
      Form renders with new org message and handleSubmit, which triggers a POST request
