//**Imported to QuizApp level and rendered there**
//**This contains the swipe and match components!**

//IMPORTING ORG DATA:
//TODO: Import all four sample data arrays from the file in libs at this level
//TODO: Take in category as a prop from where the MatchApp component is called âœ… 
//TODO: Have logic in the component that uses this category to pull the right data object in 
//TODO: Can potentially do what Alexa did with the highestCat state!! Yes, if calling it at the QuizApp component! :)

//GETTING SWIPE RESULTS:
//TODO: Make a state high enough that it can see both the swipe component and match component as an empty array to store the swipe results - here at MatchApp level??
//TODO: Pass setState fx from this down to swipe component and finish fx in swipe component that uses this to populate the state with the orgs swiped right on  
//TODO: Take in the state into this match component as a prop; this should (when rendered in the right order) now have all the swiped right orgs 
//TODO: In this component, render a nice list of all the org names and contact info for these (map fx again?)
