# Team SLA-ckers final project - VOLT

VOLT is the final project of Team SLA-ckers and is the result of 16 solid weeks of intensive learning at the School of code bootcamp in Birmingham. Just to reiterate - 4 months prior to this we knew very little about coding of any sort!

Our team was tasked with creating a volunteer app with a very open brief - basically something which connected volunteers with opportunities and organisations in their local area and online and very quickly the idea of creating a "dating app" to match the two was born.

VOLT is a progressive web application and was built to serve volunteers looking for oppoortunities to offer their time as well as the organisations who need said volunteers. As most charities or organisations would be likely using PCs or laptops to access the app and our surveying showed that the vast majority of volunteers look for opportunities on their mobile devices we felt a PWA was the ideal solution.
