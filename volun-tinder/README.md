# Team SLA-ckers final project - VOLT

VOLT is the final project of Team SLA-ckers and is the result of 16 solid weeks of intensive learning at the School of code bootcamp in Birmingham. Just to reiterate - 4 months prior to this we knew very little about coding of any sort!

Our team was tasked with creating a volunteer app with a very open brief - basically something which connected volunteers with opportunities and organisations in their local area and online and very quickly the idea of creating a "dating app" to match the two was born.

VOLT is a progressive web application and was built to serve volunteers looking for oppoortunities to offer their time as well as the organisations who need said volunteers. As most charities or organisations would be likely using PCs or laptops to access the app and our surveying showed that the vast majority of volunteers look for opportunities on their mobile devices we felt a PWA was the ideal solution.

## Getting Started

Link to repo - git clone

### Prerequisites

To install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
